Entry for r/procgen Procedural Challenge #3 - Armored Fighting Vehciles
============================

See @ http://www.dashingstrike.com/procgen/mechs/

* Heads should be able to be super low, and perhaps bigger (especially when lower)
* Occasionally generate different shoulders on each side
* Weapons better center in odd shoulders
